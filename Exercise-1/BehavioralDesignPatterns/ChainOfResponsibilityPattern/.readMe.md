# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to pass along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either **process the request** or **forward it** to the next handler in the chain.  

In this example, a leave approval system is implemented where leave requests are processed by **TeamLead**, **ProjectManager**, and **HR**. The request automatically moves along the chain until it is approved.

## Structure
- **LeaveHandler.java**: Abstract handler that defines the `handleRequest` method and a reference to the next handler.  
- **TeamLead.java**: Concrete handler that approves leave requests up to 2 days.  
- **ProjectManager.java**: Concrete handler that approves leave requests up to 5 days.  
- **HR.java**: Concrete handler that approves leave requests longer than 5 days.  
- **Main.java**: Client class that demonstrates creating the chain of handlers and sending leave requests.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Navigate to the `ChainOfResponsibilityPattern` directory.  
3. Compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
