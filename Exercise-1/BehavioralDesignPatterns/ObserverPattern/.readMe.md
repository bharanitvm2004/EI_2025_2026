# Observer Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Observer Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a **one-to-many dependency** between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all dependent objects (observers) are notified automatically.

In this example, an `iPhoneLaunchNotifier` notifies subscribed `AmazonUser`s whenever a new iPhone product is launched. Users can **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**, and receive notifications dynamically.

## Structure
- **Customer.java**: The observer interface that defines the `notify` method.  
- **AmazonUser.java**: The concrete observer that implements `Customer` and receives notifications.  
- **ProductLaunchNotifier.java**: The subject interface with `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and `notifyCustomers` methods.  
- **iPhoneLaunchNotifier.java**: The concrete subject that maintains a list of subscribers and notifies them about new product launches.  
- **Main.java**: The client class demonstrating the subscription, unsubscription, and notification flow.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Navigate to the `ObserverPattern` directory.  
3. Compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
