# Builder Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Builder Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to create different representations of an object while keeping the construction process flexible and readable.  

In this example, a `Phone` class is built using a `PhoneBuilder` class that allows method chaining to set properties like OS, processor, camera, and battery.

## Structure
- **Phone**: The product class that represents the final object to be created.  
- **PhoneBuilder**: The builder class that provides setter methods to configure the `Phone` step by step and finally create it.  
- **Main**: A client class that demonstrates creating a `Phone` object directly and using the `PhoneBuilder`.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
