# Singleton Design Pattern in Java: Music Player Controller 

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to it.  

In this example, a `MusicPlayerController` class is implemented as a Singleton to manage music playback, ensuring that only **one song plays at a time**. The class provides methods to `play` and `pause` songs.  

**Initialization Type:** Lazy Initialization (the singleton instance is created **only when it is first requested** through `getInstance()`).

---

## Structure
- **MusicPlayerController**: A singleton class that ensures only one music controller exists. It provides `play` and `pause` methods to manage music playback.  
- **Main**: A client class that demonstrates using the `MusicPlayerController` singleton.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java Main.java
