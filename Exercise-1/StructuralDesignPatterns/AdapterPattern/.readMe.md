# Adapter Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Adapter Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.

In this example, we have a `CarDealer` that needs to sell both **Indian Cars** and **European Cars**. Since they have different interfaces, a `CarAdapter` is used to unify them under a common `Car` interface so the dealer can work with both seamlessly.

## Structure
- **Car**: The target interface that defines the expected behavior for all cars.  
- **IndianCar**: A concrete class that implements the `Car` interface directly.  
- **EuropeanCar**: A class with a different interface (incompatible with `Car`).  
- **CarAdapter**: The adapter class that wraps `EuropeanCar` and makes it compatible with the `Car` interface.  
- **CarDealer**: The client class that sells cars using the `Car` interface, without worrying about differences.  
- **Main**: Demonstrates selling both Indian and European cars using the adapter.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.  
3. Compile the Java files:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
