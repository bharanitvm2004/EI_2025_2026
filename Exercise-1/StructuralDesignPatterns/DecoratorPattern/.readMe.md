# Decorator Design Pattern in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Decorator Design Pattern** in Java.  
The Decorator pattern is used to **add new behavior to objects dynamically** without modifying their existing structure.  

In this example, a `Coffee` interface defines basic coffee behavior. Concrete classes like `SimpleCoffee` and `ColdCoffee` implement this interface. Decorators such as `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` dynamically add extra features (milk, sugar) to coffee objects, allowing flexible combinations of coffee customizations.

## Structure
- **Coffee**: The target interface that defines `getDescription()` and `getCost()`.  
- **SimpleCoffee**: A concrete class representing a basic coffee.  
- **ColdCoffee**: A concrete class representing cold coffee.  
- **CoffeeDecorator**: The abstract decorator class that wraps a `Coffee` object and delegates method calls.  
- **MilkDecorator**: A concrete decorator that adds milk to a coffee object.  
- **SugarDecorator**: A concrete decorator that adds sugar to a coffee object.  
- **Main**: Demonstrates creating coffee objects and dynamically applying decorators.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.  
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.  
3. Compile the Java files:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
