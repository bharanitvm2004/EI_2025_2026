Smart Office Facility Management System in Java
Overview
This project simulates a Smart Office environment using core Java and essential Behavioral and Creational Design Patterns. The system manages meeting room configuration, live occupancy tracking, and automated environmental controls (AC and Lights).

The application is built upon three primary patterns:

Singleton Pattern: Ensures the entire facility is managed by a single instance of SmartOffice.

Observer Pattern: Automatically controls the ClimateControlSystem and LightingSystem whenever a room's occupancy state changes.

Command Pattern: Encapsulates all user operations (e.g., booking, adding occupants) into command objects for clean execution and decoupling.

Structure
The application code is organized into packages to maintain high separation of concerns:

designpatterns/Command.java: Interface for all executable user operations.

designpatterns/Observer.java: Interface for control systems that react to room state changes.

office/SmartOffice.java: The Singleton class; manages all rooms and executes commands.

office/MeetingRoom.java: The Subject class; manages a room's state (occupancy, booking) and notifies Observers.

controls/ClimateControlSystem.java: A concrete Observer that switches AC ON/OFF.

controls/LightingSystem.java: A concrete Observer that switches lights ON/OFF.

commands/*.java (e.g., BookRoomCommand.java): The set of concrete Command objects for every system action.

MainApp.java: The Client class; handles console input, parses commands, and runs the main simulation loop (including the 5-minute auto-release check).

Core System Rules
Mandatory Configuration: Capacity must be configured (Capacity>0) before occupants can be added.

Occupancy Threshold: A room is marked occupied only if the occupant count is â‰¥2.

Auto-Release: A booked room with 0 occupants is released after a simulated 5-minute grace period.

How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.

Compile all Java files, preserving the package structure.

# This example assumes you are running from the src/ directory
javac MainApp.java commands/*.java controls/*.java designpatterns/*.java office/*.java

Run the application:

java MainApp

Start by configuring the system (e.g., to create 3 rooms):

config room count 3

Command Usage
For a full list of commands and their formats, type help in the running application console. Examples include:

config room max capacity 1 12

block room 2 10:30 90

add occupant 1 3

room status 1
